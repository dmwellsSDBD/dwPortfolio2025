          <p>Welcome to my resume and portfolio site. I am <span class="name">David Wells</span>, a technology professional with over 25 years of experience in web design, development, and IT-related fields. Seven years ago, I transitioned into education, where I have been teaching technology at both high school and collegiate levels while maintaining my passion for web design and development.</p>
          
          <p>Throughout my professional career, I have gained comprehensive experience across multiple technology domains, including Network Administration, Technology Support, Desktop Application Development, Graphic Design, and Web Design & Development, among others.</p>
          
          <p>My educational journey began over 20 years ago when I first taught adult technology classes for the Northern New York Library Network. I subsequently earned my Master of Science in Education with a focus on Technology in Education from SUNY Potsdam. I continued working in software development and desktop support until 2018, when I was invited to teach a software development program at the Seaway Area Technical Center in Norwood, NY.</p>
          
          <p>Since joining the education sector, I have found great fulfillment in teaching technology. The program I lead has evolved into what is now called Computer & Information Sciences, expanding beyond web and application development to encompass a comprehensive survey of Computer Science disciplines. I take pride in helping to educate the next generation of computer scientists, software engineers, cybersecurity specialists, game developers, and data scientists.</p>
